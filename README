OHack - An open source hack for World of Warcraft

To use it, build it, and use FailInjector (in another repo on my github) to inject the DLL into WoW.

The Fail.* files are part of a small lib I wrote for use in another project. I don't care if anyone else uses them, but they might have bugs; I haven't tested them a lot.
