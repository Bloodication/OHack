OHack - An open source hack for World of Warcraft

To use it, build it, and use FailInjector (in another repo on my github) to inject the DLL into WoW.

You can use any of the code in this, as long as you give credit to me (fail46 or l0l1dk) and you don't sell it.

The Fail.* files are part of a small lib I wrote for use in another project. I don't care if anyone else uses them, but they might have bugs; I haven't tested them a lot.
